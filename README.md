# Time-Series Analysis and Prediction Framework

This project is a comprehensive time-series analysis and prediction framework built with **PyTorch** and **Optuna** for training, evaluating, and optimizing machine learning models. The primary focus is on predicting mass values from sensor data using **Transformer** and **CNN** architectures, while incorporating **FFT-based features** for enhanced frequency domain insights.

---

## Features

- **Preprocessing**:
  - Handles large time-series datasets with outlier removal (Isolation Forest and rolling z-score methods).
  - Scales features and target variables using `StandardScaler`.
  - Splits data into train, validation, and test sets with temporal and stratified strategies.

- **Models**:
  - Transformer-based model with positional encoding and self-attention mechanisms.
  - CNN-based model for localized feature extraction.
  - **FFT Integration**: Automatically extracts Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) features from acceleration signals to enhance model inputs by incorporating both time-domain and frequency-domain data.

- **Hyperparameter Optimization**:
  - Automated optimization using **Optuna** for key parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and dropout rates.

- **Training**:
  - Mixed-precision training with gradient clipping for stability.
  - Implements checkpointing, early stopping, and learning rate scheduling.

- **Evaluation**:
  - Generates detailed plots for predictions, residuals, and log-transformed residuals.
  - Computes key metrics such as MSE, MAE, and RÂ².
